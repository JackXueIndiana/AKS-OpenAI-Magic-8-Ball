# AKS-OpenAI-Magic-8-Ball
This repo is a copy from https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-openai-terraform. I made needed changes to the Terraform files to make the project deployable in southcentralus with gpt3.5-turbo 0301. I also made the needed changes in requirements.txt to make the python app runnable on a pc without GPU and against python 3.11.4.
